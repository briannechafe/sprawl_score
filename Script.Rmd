## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

##Load required libraries & set working directory
```{r}
library(rgdal)
library(dplyr)
library(Hmisc)
library(R2WinBUGS)
library(maptools)
library(spdep)
library(car)
library(readtext)
library(reticulate)
setwd("C:/Users/Henry/Documents/sprawl_score")
```

```{r}
GDB_path <- paste(getwd(), "/Sprawl.gdb", sep="")
CTs <- readOGR(GDB_path,"Sprawl_indicators_11")
##DAs within the CTs
DAs <- readOGR(GDB_path, "DAs_within_CTs_prj_11")
```

##Identify DAs belonging to the same CT, and calculate coefficients of variation in population & employment densities
```{r}
CTUID <- CTs@data$CTUID
DA_within <- filter(DAs@data, DAs@data$CTUID==CTUID[1])
```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
